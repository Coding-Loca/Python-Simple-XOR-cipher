# Python-Simple-XOR-cipher

<h1> About </h1>

A simple python script which performs an XOR operation between two inputs, the text to be encrypted and a key. It performs the operation between the individual string characters.

<h1> Usage </h1>

The script asks you for the two inputs, you can enter them either manually or use contents of a .txt file. Keep in mind that the key has to be equal or longer in character length than the text to be encrypted. 

Besides encryption it can also decrypt. Consider that the input for the text to be decrypted has to be in the same format as the output in the encryption script - a hexstring.
